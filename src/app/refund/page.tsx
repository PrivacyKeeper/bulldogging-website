    "Refund terms for Bulldogging.pro subscriptions, and how rodeo entry fees, office charges, hazer credits and mount money are handled.",

};

const sections = [
  {
    h: "1. Subscriptions",
    p: "Premium subscriptions are billed monthly or annually and renew automatically until cancelled. You may cancel at any time; cancellation takes effect at the end of your current billing period and you keep premium access until then.",
  },
  {
    h: "2. App Store Purchases",
    p: "Subscriptions purchased through the Apple App Store or Google Play are governed by that store's refund policy and must be requested directly from Apple or Google. We cannot issue refunds for store-processed purchases on their behalf.",
  },
  {
    h: "3. Purchases Made Directly",
    p: "For subscriptions purchased directly through us, contact support@bulldogging.pro within 14 days of the charge and we will review the request. Refunds are issued to the original payment method.",
  },
  {
    h: "4. Entry Fees and Office Charges",
    p: "Entry fees are collected on behalf of event producers and are subject to that producer's own entry, draw-out, and refund terms — including the office charge, which is typically non-refundable. Requests to draw out or withdraw an entry must go to the producer. We can help you reach them, but we cannot override a producer's refund terms.",
  },
  {
    h: "5. Hazer Credits and Mount Money Are Not Payments We Process",
    p: "Hazer shares and mount money are settled directly between the people involved. We calculate the amounts and keep a shared ledger, but we never hold, transfer, or refund those funds, and marking a settlement settled is something a user does rather than something we verify. If a hazer no-shows or a horse is not available, that is between you and them.",
  },
  {
    h: "6. Reruns, Fines, and Corrections",
    p: "Reruns, steer changes and official overrides change results, not fees. Fines for unnecessary roughness are levied by the association or producer, not by us, and are progressively doubled under most rulebooks; any dispute goes to the body that assessed the fine. Where a correction changes a payout after money has been distributed, resolution is between the producer and the association — and note that a corrected payout also changes the hazer credit and any mount money owed on that run.",
  },
  {
    h: "7. Cancelled or Postponed Events",
    p: "If a producer cancels or postpones a rodeo, refunds are handled by that producer under their stated terms. Where an event is cancelled for biosecurity or venue reasons, we will surface the producer's notice and refund instructions in the app as soon as we receive them.",
  },
  {
    h: "8. Marketplace Transactions",
    p: "Marketplace sales — horses, tack, cattle, rigs, and services — are between buyer and seller. We are not a party to those transactions and do not issue refunds for them.",
  },
  {
    h: "9. Contact",
    p: "Refund questions can be sent to support@bulldogging.pro.",
  },
